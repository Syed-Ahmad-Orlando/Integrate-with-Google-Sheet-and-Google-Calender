# Integrate-with-Google-Sheet-and-Google-Calender
The purpose of this project is to integrate NetSuite with Google Contacts and Google Calendar. Customer contact information will automatically be added to Google Contacts, and whenever an event is created in NetSuite, a meeting will be scheduled with the client and updated in the userâ€™s personal Google Calendar.
